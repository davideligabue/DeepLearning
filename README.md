# DeepLearning
Exam for the course 'Deep Learning'.

If you don't want to retrain the model defined in the notebook you can download the pretrained weights using the cell under the paragraph **Load the weights**.

You have to uncomment and run the cell which will download the weights using gdown and the they will be loaded in the model with the function `load_weight` of the class `Seq2Seq`.

In this case be carefull to run all the notebook except for the paragraph Training.

Otherwise if you want to retrain all the model you can run the notebook without changing anything.
